Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from and make decisions based on data.
It involves training algorithms with large datasets to identify patterns and improve performance over time.
Key techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Applications of machine learning are widespread, spanning fields such as finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems.
The field continues to advance, driven by increases in computing power and data availability.
